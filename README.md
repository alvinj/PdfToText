PDF to Text
===========

This project contains a little GUI application that you can read a PDF file and display a plain text
version of the pages you request in its output area. It also contains a Scala shell script that lets
you do the same thing from the command line.

Building the Mac OS X Application
---------------------------------

You can build the GUI into a "native" Mac OS X application using the _assemble-run.sh_ shell script
located in the project's root directory. See that shell script and the code it calls for more
details on how it works.

More Information
----------------

This is a very small side project for me, so I'm not adding many details here. You can find more
information about this project at this URL:

You can also find more information about how I build Java and Scala applications into native
Mac OS X applications on my website:

If you happen to be looking for that specific topic, this URL will show some of the tutorials
I've written on the subject:

Summary
-------

If you were looking for some source code to help you convert PDF content to plain text, I hope
this project will be helpful to you.
